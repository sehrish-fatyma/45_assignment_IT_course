// 45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
// should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
// with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
// color or an optional feature.
// Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
// stored correctly.

import { features } from "process";
